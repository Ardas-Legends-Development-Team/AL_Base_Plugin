## Our Community Standards
This Project is part of the Ardas Legends Community and therefor follows the rules set by said community.
The rules in their full extend can be found on the [discord]().
For interaction with other people in within this Project following rules are the most important.

1. We have zero tolerance for harassment and discrimination. No racism, no homophobia, transphobia, sexism, etc.
2. Treat each other with respect. Differences are normal and should be talked out respectfully. We don´t want any conflict.
3. Any NSFW or harmful content is forbidden.
4. Conversations, notes, comments should always be in english.
5. Have common sense, we are not going to write a rule for every scenario. Just cause something isn´t listed specifically in the rules doesn´t mean you can just do it. If you have to check if you are allowed to post something, most likely you shouldn´t post it.
6. If you have any issues with other contributors contact Anedhel.
7. Anedhel has the final word on every decision made regarding this project.
